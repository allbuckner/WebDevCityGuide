          <p>Next up is one of St. Louis' largest attractions: The St. Louis Zoo.
          As one of the best Zoo's in the country, this is not an attraction you
          want to miss out on. With an enormous selection of animals in their
          simulated natural environments, one could wander the zoo for hours
          watching and learning about creatures different from ourselves. The Zoo,
          similar to the Science Center, is a publicly funded, and therefore free
          to enter, locale. Thus for no money at all you can tour and experience
          the countless animal exhibits that are offered. Also similar to th
          Science Center, if you're willing to part with some cash you'll get the
          opportunity to see special shows and some premium exhibits that may
          come around.<p>

        <div class="fp2"><p>Third in our line up is Forest Park. This 1,371 acre park could
            certainly be considered the cities largest attraction (in area) and it
            also contains many of the cities most popular attractions including the
            two mentioned previously. In addition to those two, Forest Park is also
            home to interesting locales like The St. Louis Art Museum, The Boat House
            and more. It even serves as a location for various major seasonal events
            such as fair St. Louis which takes place every July and attracts visitors

          This monument got St. Louis it's name as "The Gateway to the West" and

          Whether you visit to travel up to the top and look over the city
          or if you'd rather travel beneath and visit the St. Louis Arch Museum,
          there's no avoiding an entertaining experience at the Arch. Even if you
          just swing by to look the at the monument, seeing it in person is well
          worth it.<p>
